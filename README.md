Hello there, this is David Main's profile.

I am a software engineer and data wrangler living in Denver in the colorful state of Colorado.
I have worked in IT now for over thirty years, and though that sounds like a long time, I still am learning new things.
And that is what has kept me doing this for so long.  I really love it!

Here at Capital Rx, I am a Senior Backend Developer ][ and am on the HODL Team.

You can reach me here at davidmain@cap-rx.com.

If you speak German or French, and want to have a little conversation, practice a little, just reach out to me on Slack.
I am always looking for conversation partners to keep my skills up!  Tschüß and Adieu!
